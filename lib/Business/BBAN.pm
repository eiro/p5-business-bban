# ABSTRACT: helpers to compute BBAN key and generate an BBAN.

=head1 NAME

Business::BBAN - helpers to compute BBAN key and generate an BBAN.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Package helper to compute BBAN key and generate an BBAN from a bank
identifier, a bank location identifier and an account identifier.

Converts alpha characters into digit following the described table (beware,
there is a gap between R and S):

    Char        | Digit
    --------------------
    A, J        | 1
    B, K, S     | 2
    C, L, T     | 3
    D, M, U     | 4
    E, N, V     | 5
    F, O, W     | 6
    G, P, X     | 7
    H, q, Y     | 8
    I, R, Z     | 9

=head2 to_digit ( $bban )

when C<$bban> is  string representation of the Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN),
which can contains some alpha caracters.

returns string representation of the Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN), which
contains only digits.

=cut

sub to_digit (_) {
    my $bban = shift;
    $bban = uc $bban;

    $bban =~ s/([A-R])/(((ord $1) - 56) % 9) + 1/eg;
    $bban =~ s/([S-Z])/(((ord $1) - 56) % 9) + 2/eg;

    $bban;
} 

=head2 compute_key ( $bban )

Computes the key corresponding to a given Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN)

when C<$bban> is a string representation of the Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN),
which contains only digits, but does not contains the key part. 

returns the computed key of the BBAN given in parameter. 

=cut

sub compute_key (_) {
    my $bban = shift.'00';
    my $rest = 0;
    map { $rest = ($rest * 10 + $_ ) % 97 } split //, $bban;
    my $key = 97 - $rest;
    if($key < 10)
    {
        $key = '0'.$key;
    }

    $key;
}

=head2 get_BBAN ( $bank_id, $bank_location_id, $account_id )

Computes and returns the Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) corresponding to the
given bank identifier, bank location identifier and the account identifier. When

    $bank_id            is the bank identifier.
    $bank_locaiton_id   is the bank location identifier.
    $account_id         is the account identifier.

return the string representation of the Basic Bank Account Number (BBAN) with
the key part. The returned BBAN can contains alpha and digit characters.

=cut

sub get_BBAN {
    my $bank_id = shift;
    my $bank_location_id = shift;
    my $account_id = shift;

    my $bban = $bank_id.$bank_location_id.$account_id;
    my $bban_digit = to_digit($bban);
    my $bban_key = compute_key($bban_digit);

    $bban.$bban_key;
}
